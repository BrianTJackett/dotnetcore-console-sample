# Extra Day 2 - Create Microsoft ToDo tasks

This sample was added after the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph blog series and as such has limited documentation.  The key points to note:

- Permissions required
  - Delegated (work or school account)
    - Tasks.ReadWrite
- appsettings.json
  - Specify the query keyword to search against in addition to standard configuration values.
